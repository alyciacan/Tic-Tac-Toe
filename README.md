*********

## Introduction
Sure, you *could* play Tic-Tac-Toe on paper, but why not shoot for the stars and go paperless? Grab a friend, choose from one of two
awesomely adorable space-age-themed tokens, and have fun! The app even tracks your wins, so you don't have to!

Play remotely or via Zoom using [remote screen control](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362673-Requesting-or-giving-remote-control)!

## Technologies
* Javascript     
* CSS

## Features
* Classic Tic-Tac-Toe rules apply, so a "win" can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. Users cannot select a space that is already occupied.    
* Players' scores are displayed and updated automatically.   
* Gameboard resets automatically following each win or tie.
* Instructions are clearly displayed and update as each player takes their turn.      
* Fun animation when a player has won.    
* Alt text added for increased accessibility.

## About this Project
  A student in the [Turing](https://turing.edu/) Front-End program, I completed this project during my fifth week of being a developer (Mod 1, in Turing-speak). This was our end-of-mod solo assignment, and I had a **blast** (üöÄ pun very much intended) building this out on my own. In case you're interested, [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/tic-tac-toe-solo-v2.html) are the project specs. I used the Git workflow, which is making more and more sense to me as I get more practice!

## Wins and Challenges
* I was really excited to get the chance to plan this undertaking on my own. I used [Trello](https://trello.com/alyciacanavan/boards) to organize my work, set deadlines for myself, and add "to dos" as I went. I sketched out my HTML "skeleton" by hand before doing any coding. I also used Replit to "test" my ideas for gameplay functionality.    
* The functionality and design came together for me quickly, which allowed me to focus a good amount of time on my refactor. I used Turing's Style Guides to refactor my JS, CSS, and HTML. I also employed the BEM naming convention when writing my HTML.     
* I also added some pizzazz to my project, including alt text for accessibility and animation.    
* One challenge I encountered was the balance between responsive and reliable CSS. Let me explain - I üíú Flexbox, and would gladly use it for everything. But sometimes dimensions just need to be hard-coded, and I am learning when to flex and when to be more hard-headed.
* I really wanted to add CSS breakpoints that would allow for my game to be played on mobile devices, but decided to "put a pin in" that idea, at least until we learn how it's done!

## Shoutouts üì£ 
* First to my Project Manager, Leta, for fielding my multiple questions about just how far I could deviate from the comp.
* Second to my family, for not being (visibly) embarrassed or exasperated when I spent a whole dinner date talking through how to tell a computer how Tic-Tac-Toe works.    
* Third to my fabulous mentor, Meg, who is always terrifically supportive and agreed to help me with my refactor!
